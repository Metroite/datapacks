## Getting Started

Every folder in here is its own datapack. Download links and datapack specific information can be found inside these datapacks.

### Installing

Its easy.

Move the datapack(s) you wish to use inside your "datapacks" folder of your save file(s) found in `.minecraft\saves`.

```
C:\Users\<User>\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\saves\<world name>\datapacks
```

Now just join the world you put the datapacks in and execute the following operator command:

```
/reload
```

A "loaded" message should appear, assuring you that its up and running. Have fun trying out the new stuff!

### Version

The master branch is developed for the latest version of Minecraft! I aim to provide 100% multiplayer-proof datapacks.

All datapacks are available for Minecraft [1.13 (unsupported)](https://github.com/Metroite/datapacks/tree/1.13), [1.14/1.15](https://github.com/Metroite/datapacks/tree/1.14) and possibly for even [later versions on the master branch](https://github.com/Metroite/datapacks/tree/master).

**This is  the 1.14/1.15 branch**. Switch branches to get to the respective versions.
