## Getting Started

Every folder in here is its own datapack. Download links and datapack specific information can be found inside these datapacks.

### Installing

Its easy.

Move the datapack(s) you wish to use inside your "datapacks" folder of your save file(s) found in `.minecraft\saves`.

```
C:\Users\<User>\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\saves\<world name>\datapacks
```

Now just join the world you put the datapacks in and execute the following operator command (autocompletion [TAB] will be your friend here):

```
/datapack enable <name of the added datapack>
```
A "loaded"-text should appear, assuring you that its up and running.

Have fun trying out the new stuff you have added!

## Version

All datapacks are available for [1.13 (outdated)](https://github.com/Metroite/datapacks/tree/1.13) and [1.14](https://github.com/Metroite/datapacks/tree/master). **This is  the 1.14 branch**, click on [1.13 (outdated)](https://github.com/Metroite/datapacks/tree/1.13) to switch to its branch. I aim to provide 100% multiplayer-proof datapacks.
