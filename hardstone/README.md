Removed buttery consistency out of stone/grass/sandstone/netherrack. Caving might be a better option than strip-mining. Craft cobblestone slabs together into cobblestone. Cobblestone tools have become flint tools. Iron and Gold now drop *Raw Iron/Gold* instead, which can be smelted into the corresponding nugget. Diamonds might pling away. Be careful in the nether!
