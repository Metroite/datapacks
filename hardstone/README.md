## [hardstone](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/Metroite/datapacks/tree/master/hardstone&rootDirectory=false)

Removed buttery consistency out of stone/grass/sandstone/netherrack. Caving might be a better option than stip mining. Craft cobblestone slabs together into cobblestone. Cobblestone tools have become flint tools. Iron and Gold now drop Raw Iron/Gold instead, which can be smelted into the corresponding nugget. Diamonds might pling away. Be careful in the nether!
