# Release r2: The "Hurtful" Difficulty

## After about one and a half years I present to you, the [Hurtful Pack r2](https://github.com/Metroite/datapacks/tree/master/Hurtful%20Pack) which consists of many smaller datapacks aiming to make every Minecrafters life a lot harder!

...a datapack pack?

The evolution from release 1 to release 2 is so big, that its progress could only be put into perspective by comparing
the amount of .mcfunction files, which have increased by **1893%**
or by comparing the line count, which have increased by **1143%**

while also having decrased the amount of performance impactful NBT lookups and @<!-- -->e selectors per file by **64%**
