## [limitedlife](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/Metroite/datapacks/tree/master/limitedlife&rootDirectory=false)

limitedlife limits the max health of a player by a heart every death. Max health can be restored if a *Batwing* is thrown into a water-filled cauldron under an End Crystal. The "Absorption" effect will be needed!
Also, you can craft a different kind of Elytra using *Batwings* (tip: burns on daylight)!

Recommended to use with graves (*Batwings* will be replaced with *Skull Dust*), ventilators (more uses for *Batwings*) and sapphire (to be able to turn your *Life Support Glass* into *Life Support Sapphire Glass* by holding it in your offhand).
