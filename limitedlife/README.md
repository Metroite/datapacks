## [limitedlife](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/Metroite/datapacks/tree/1.14/limitedlife&rootDirectory=false)

limitedlife limits the max health of a player by a heart every death. Max health can be restored if a *Batwing* is thrown into a water-filled cauldron under an End Crystal. The "Absorption" effect will be needed!
Also, you can craft a different kind of Elytra using *Batwings* (tip: burns on daylight, tip2: "Milk Bucket" recipe book entry)!
Recommended to use with graves (*Batwings* will be replaced with *Skull Dust*), loud2x2tnt, ventilators and sapphire.
