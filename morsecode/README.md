A very smooth way of wireless communication.

Put a redstone_torch inside an item_frame on a gold_block (sender) with a redstone_wire/button on top or an iron_block (receiver) with a redstone_wire on top. The ItemRotation will decide which one of the eight interdimensional frequencies to use.

Comes with a "Mobile Receiver", where the frequencies are defined by the hotbar slot it is in (2 to 9).

To disable wireless redstone mode, set *$wirelessredstone$* in *mc.itemrotation* to 0 or 1 if **both** modes are wanted or 2 if **only** the wireless redstone mode is wanted (1 is default, in the hurtfulpack 0 is default): `/scoreboard players set $wirelessredstone$ mc.itemrotation 0`
