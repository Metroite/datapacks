Ender Pearls won't deal damage if this datapack is installed! On top of that, if they're thrown at a Dragon Egg, the player will be teleported someplace far away.

Set *$accuracy$* in *ue.pearlthrow* higher, if the server is experiencing lag due to this datapack (3 is default): `/scoreboard players set $accuracy$ ue.pearlthrow 3`
