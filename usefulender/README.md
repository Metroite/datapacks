Ender Pearls won't deal damage if this datapack is installed! On top of that, if they're thrown at a Dragon Egg, the player will be teleported someplace far away. They don't need to be thrown either, just hold them with your offhand and shoot with a (cross)bow!

Set *$accuracy$* in *ue.pearlthrow* higher, if the server is experiencing lag (3 is default): `/scoreboard players set $accuracy$ ue.pearlthrow 3`

Set *$distance$* in *ue.pearlthrow* higher, if either $accuracy$ is low or if somehow damage is still received (8 is default): `/scoreboard players set $distance$ ue.pearlthrow 8`
