# Useful Scripts

Here I will maintain some of my hopefully useful scripts in regards to Minecraft.

This Python script will try to unfold your datapacks into their line-by-line command structure. To convert them into actual One Command Creations copy-paste the output into any Command Combiner like this one from MrGarreto: https://mrgarretto.com/cmdcombiner
