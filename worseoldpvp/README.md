You want the worse, old PvP back? Worry no more, this datapack will fulfill your wishes! Just drop your tools once to update them and enjoy your eZ, no-skill version of PvP.

Set *$extend$* in *wop.extend* higher, the more the server is lagging (6 is default): `/scoreboard players set $extend$ wop.extend 6`

Change *$mode$* in *wop.extend* from 0 to 2 if only the sword-block (1) or the no-cooldown (2) is wanted (0 is default): `/scoreboard players set $mode$ wop.extend 0`
