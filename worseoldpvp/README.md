You want the worse, old PvP back? Worry no more, this datapack will fulfill your wishes! Just drop your tools once to update them and enjoy your eZ, no-skill version of PvP.

Set *$extend$* in *wop.extend* higher, the more the server is lagging (6 is default): `/scoreboard players set $extend$ wop.extend 6`

Use one of the mode funtions numbered from 0 to 2 if only the sword-block (1) or the no-cooldown (2) is wanted (0 is default): `/function worseoldpvp:mode/0`
Alternatively you can change ones mode individually by changing the palyers *wop.mode* score (0 is default): `/scoreboard players set <player> wop.mode 0`
